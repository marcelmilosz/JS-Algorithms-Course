Here are all my files that I did during this awesome course on Algorithms and Data Structures on Udemy

This course took me about 3 weeks to finish. I tried to spend on it about 2 hours a day. 

It gave be some cool knowledge about:

Big O notation, time complexity and space complexity

Sorting algorighms like:
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Radix sort
- Quick sort

Data structures:
- Single linked lists
- Double linked lists
- Binary Tree 
- Binary Heap 
- Hash Table 
- Graphs

All files here have a prefix:
- r* --> recursion 
- ds* --> data structures
- s* --> sorting
- <num>* --> single excercise to focus on Time and space complexity
